Description: We designed this package to provide function for area level of Small Area Estimation using Hierarchical Bayesian method under Generalized Poisson Distribution. This package provides model using Univariate Generalized Poisson Distribution for variable of interest. Some datasets simulated by a data generation are also provided. The "rjags" package is employed to obtain parameter estimates. Model-based estimators involves the HB estimators which include the mean and the variation of mean. For reference, see Rao and Molina (2015) and Wang (2021).
